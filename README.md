## About Me

#### I live in Oregon City. Currently I am enrolled in CIT-262 DevOps at BYU-I.
#### I have worked as an IT Systems and Security Engineer for the past 10 years, though I've been in the industry for over 25 years. My favorite movie is The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
#### I'm really looking forward to learning on how to use GitHub as a version control system and collaborate with my team!
